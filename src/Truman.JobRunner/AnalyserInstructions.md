I need to analyse a number of articles. For each article, I need to extract the following fields:

* A link to the original article
* sentiment: A sentiment score for the article on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is very negative and 10 is very positive
* tags: Up to 10 tags... keywords that capture the essence of the article

In addition to the fields above, I also need one field for each of the values listed above, with a score between 0 and 10 indicating how closely related the article is to that value. A score of 0 means no relation, while a score of 10 means it is highly related.

I need the response as a JSON object (so in JSON format).
